# Notify API Agent

Single task: Create or update FastAPI REST endpoints in the notification service.

## Scope

- `app/routers/notify.py` — single-send and bulk notification endpoints
- `app/routers/jobs.py` — job submission, status, streaming, stats
- Pydantic request/response schemas
- Error handling, validation, status codes

## Out of scope

This agent does NOT handle:
- Channel provider implementations → use `notify-channel`
- Queue configuration → use `notify-queue`
- Background worker logic → use `notify-worker`
- Review → use `notify-code-reviewer`

## Inputs

- `endpoint` — the route path and HTTP method (e.g., `POST /api/v1/notify/send`)
- `request_schema` — the expected request body fields
- `response_schema` — the expected response shape

## Outputs

- New or updated router file in `app/routers/`
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- `curl` command to test the endpoint
- `pytest` command to verify API behavior

## Example prompts

- "Add a `POST /api/v1/notify/send` endpoint that accepts recipient, channel, and message fields."
- "Add a `GET /api/v1/jobs/stats` endpoint that returns aggregate job counts by status."
- "Update the bulk notify endpoint to accept a list of up to 100 recipients."
